<!-- PROJECT DESCRIPTION -->

# ChatGPT-App <a name="about-project"></a>

**ChatGPT-App** is a web application that enables users to create three different types of chats by utilizing the ChatGPT API. With this app, users can register, log in, and submit images to their chats, as well as converse with the bot. The front-end was developed using React and Redux Toolkit Query, while the back-end was built using Express, CORS, Helmet, and Morgan, along with OpenAI.

**Please note that this project currently utilizes a free trial of the OpenAI API, which is set to expire in May-June of 2023. I will be working to update the API key following this period.
